âœ¨Iâ€™m a Systems Engineer, wife, mother and a woman eager to learn every day. Here begins my journey to become a self-taught web developer. But first I must tell you that I was in a MinTic bootcamp for six months with the Universidad Industrial de Santander where I learned basic programming in Python and Java, in addition to working for three months in a team until I deployed a web application.

Now my purpose is to become a web developer and that is why I decided to start with the Front-End HTML and CSS were one of my first courses.âœ¨
